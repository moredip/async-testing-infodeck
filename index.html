        <p>We'll use an example of adding a new user to the system. We have a UserRegistrar who is responsible for adding a new user. It does that by asking the AJAX Service to make a POST request to the appropriate URL. Once the POST request completes we have successfully create a user, so the UserRegistrar also completes.
        </p>
        <p>If we were implementing this in synchronous code we'd probably end up with something along the lines of what is illustrated by this Sequence Diagram.

          <li data-name='call-add-user'>
            someone calls UserRegistrar.addUser(...)
          </li>

            addUser asks the AJAX service to make a post request, providing post parameters

        <p>
          Testing a synchronous function like this is pretty straight forward. As an example let's first look at how we'd test that addUser is providing the right post parameters to the AJAX service's post function.
        </p><p>
          We can replace the real AJAX service with a test double, or fake implementation. This implementation won't actually make an AJAX call when its post function is called. Instead it will just make a note of which parameters were called and immediately return. This means that after the addUser function has completed the test can go and ask the fake AJAX service what parameters were passed to it, and thus verify that the expected parameters were indeed passed in.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li data-name='send-post-params'>
            the UserRegistrar sends the post params to the fake AJAX service
          </li>
          <li data-name='lookup-post-params'>
            later, the test asks the fake ajax service for the post params which the UserRegistrar sent
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        In the previous example we were checking that the subject of our test was asking its dependencies to do the right thing. We will also often have tests where we need to check how the subject of our test handles different responses from its dependencies after it asks them to do something. 
        </p><p>
        In the context of our examples so far the UserRegistry's addUser method is the <b>test subject</b> (sometimes referred to as the <i>System Under Test</i> or SUT). The AJAX service is a <b>test dependency</b> - something which test subject depends upon to achieve its goals. Earlier we checked that the test subject was asking its dependencies the right questions. Now we'll check that it handles the answers which that dependency (the AJAX service) comes back with. Let's suppose that the post call that we make to create a user returns the id of the newly created user. We want to make sure that our addUser method takes that id and adds it to the user instance it is provided with. 
        </p><p>
          To achieve this goal we'll again replace the real AJAX service with a test double. We then configure the test double to return a specific response from its post method when it is called by the addUser method. That fake response will contain a specific user id. Once we have everything set up we then invoke the test subject - the addUser method - and check that it pulls the user id from the fake post response we set up and adds it to the user instance that was passed to addUser.

          <h1>An aside: types of test input and output</h1>
        </a>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, isolated tests are all about input and output. For a given test we provide a set of controlled inputs into the system and then verify that a certain set of outputs came out of it. It's useful to put these inputs and outputs into 4 distinct categories, as per the X-Unit Testing Patterns book. 
        </p><p>
        The simplest categories are Direct Input and Direct Output. For low-level unit tests Direct Input would be parameters in methods called on the test subject. Direct Output would be return values from those methods. 
        </p><p>
          Indirect Output is the parameters which the test subject passes to its dependencies. For example the post parameters which the addUser method passes to the AJAX Service's post call.
        </p><p>
        Indirect Input is return values which the test subject's dependencies pass back to the test subject when the test subject calls a method on its dependencies. For example the post response data which the AJAX service's post method returns to the addUser method.

          <h1>a simple asynchronous function</h1>
        </a>
        <p> For a long-running operation like a network call it's common to use an asynchronous approach. Let's see how that could look in our AJAX service call example. </p>
        <p> Rather than blocking on the result of the service call the AJAX service will instead return immediately to the caller - not waiting for the actual network call to complete. Once the network call has completed the AJAX service will let the caller know by invoking a <i>callback function</i> wich was provided by the caller when it asked the AJAX service to perform a post.</p>
        <p> This asynchronous approach is common in event-based systems such as web browsers and UI frameworks. Evented server-side frameworks like Twisted, EventMachine, and Node take advantage of this approach too. It's a powerful and efficient way of dealing with slow-running operations, but it does take a while to get your head around. It also necessitates a more nuanced approach to isolated testing, as we'll see.</p>

          <h1>testing indirect input and output in async code</h1>
        </a>
        <p>
          Earlier we discussed testing that our UserRegistrar's addUser method uses an AJAX service correctly. In those examples addUser was our <i>test subject</i> and the AJAX service was a <i>test dependency</i>. We were testing the <i>Indirect Output</i> of the test subject, and also how the test subject responded to particular sets of <i>Indirect Input</i>. Let's see how our approach changes now that we're using async callbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases our approach to testing Indirect Output doesn't change in the face of async code. We can take the same approach as we would with synchronous code - replace the real test dependency with a test double, exercise our test, then verify that our test subject sent the expect parameters to the faked-out test dependency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing Indirect Input with async code is where things get a bit more complex. With our <a href="#simple-sync-ajax-test-return">synchronous code example</a> we just had to replace the test dependency with a test double which would return the appropriate value. But with asynchronous code Indirect Input doesn't come in to the test subject via return values. Instead the Indirect Input is passed into our test subject as a parameter in the callback which the test subject itself passed to the test double. So our tests need to start passing Indirect Input into our test subject via those callback parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's illustrate how this is achieved by looking at a concrete example of a test where we need to pass specific Indirect Input into our test subject. We'll use the same example that we used earlier for testing Indirect Input - verifying that the user id in the AJAX post response is added to the user instance - but we'll be testing the async version of the code.
        </p>
        <p>As with previous tests, during the test setup we've replaced the AJAX service <i>test dependency</i> with a test double.
          <ol>
            <li>First, our test invokes addUser.</li>
            <li>addUser invokes post on the AJAX service, passing in the relevant post params and its async callback. The test double acts as a <i>spy</i> and makes a note of those parameters.</li>
            <li>Because this is a non-blocking system, we have the test double immediately return control to teh addUser method (as a real AJAX service would do). The addUser method does the same, immediately returning control from the addUser method to the test code</li>
            <li>The test code then goes directly to the AJAX service test double and retrieves the callback which the addUser method had originally passed to the AJAX service.</li>
            <li>The test code then invokes that callback directly, passing in a fake post response which includes the user id we'll be testing for momentarily. <b>This is the point where our test is injecting Indirect Input into our async test subject</b>.</li>
            <li>Our callback does its thing, pulling the new user id from the post response it was provided and updating the user instance with that id.</li>
            <li>Our test code verifies that the user instance has indeed been updated correctly.</li>
          </ol>

          <h1>Async tests are just tests</h1>
        </a>
        <p>
          This previous test was more complex, but when you break it down it's just combining a few of the techniques we've already used in other types of isolated test.
          Earlier we tested Indirect Output by having our test double remember the parameters that were passed to its methods. We also tested Direct Input by passing fake parameters to the test subject. You can see that tests involving Indirect Input just combine those simpler techniques together to achieve isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key aspect of this type of isolated asyncronous test is that although the code we're testing is written for an async system, <b>the test itself is synchronous</b>. The thread of execution is all completed in one turn of the event loop. We've essentially unwound the asynchronous nature of the system into a flat sequence of synchronous function calls. 
          
          <p>In fact the label 'isolated asynchronous tests' is a bit misleading. These are in fact <i>synchronous</i> tests of an async-oriented codebase.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, because our tests are synchronous we do <b>not</b> need to use any tricks in our test runner to verify that all async operations have completed. We know the test is fully completed solely by the fact that the test method has returned, just the same as when testing synchronous code. This is a key benefit to this type of isolated testing.</p>
